# Kraken-Exchange-DCA
A Python program to assist in "Dollar Cost Averaging" cryptocurrency purchases on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange via interacting with the Kraken API.
## Prerequisites
1. Python
2. Kraken exchange personal API key and Secret key

## Kraken API set up
1. Create an account at https://www.kraken.com/en-gb/sign-up
2. Go to Account>Security>API>Add Key
3. Select desired permissions for your API (approve **Querey Funds** and **Create & Modify Orders** minimum).
4. Copy personal API KEY and API SECRET into: 
> api_key= 
> 
> secret=

## Usage
The program can be used to:
1. Check current account balance of all available currencies
2. Give a precise value for the volume of currency being purchased for given fiat value (useful for purchasing small fractions of a coin)
3. Create a buy order for a given amount (**provided the account is funded**). If set to run passively, this automates the Dollar Cost Average buying strategy
4. Pull any number of past transactions from the users account. Data is then cleaned and saved to an excel file - useful for tax purposes/ general book keeping.

## Saving txn history
Cleaning and saving of past transactions is completed via the trade_history function.
"Offset" is a value used by the API for pagination, starting from a default of 0 and increasing by 50.
The first time that the function is run, all previous transactions will be saved.
To avoid future repliction or to only select the previous "x" transactions, use df.head(x) to retreive the x most recent transactions to be saved.
